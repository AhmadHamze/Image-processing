#Processing.py program


This program takes an image as an input and outputs another image (jpg file).
It sharpens the edges of a special figure from it's surroundings, this is done by drawing each pixel according to it's surroundings.
The performance of the program might degrade depending on your machine.

NOTE: If you want to use another image as input, remember to set the proper arguments for the size() function, otherwise the program won't work.
You can look for the width and height of an image by looking at it's properties.
